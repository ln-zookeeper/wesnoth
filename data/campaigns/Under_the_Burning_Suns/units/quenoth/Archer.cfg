    description= _ "With the open sands providing much less protection than their old forests did, the wide ranks of elvish archers that could once have stopped an advancing orcish horde in its tracks have all but disappeared. Instead, the few who still choose to dedicate themselves to the traditional weapon of their ancestors practise the art from the saddle, easily avoiding the perils of melee combat."
